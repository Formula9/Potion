# Formula Nine Potion

Potion is a branch split of Fabien Potencier's Pimple repository.

The purpose of this repository is to modify and customize the excellent Pimple container for the Formula Nine
framework. The framework uses both Pimple (through a clone of Silex - Formula9/Core) and the Illuminate Container 
(also encapsulated by the framework.)

Alterations will include PHP7 features and removal of some problematic code.
